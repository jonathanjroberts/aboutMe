			<h4>American Composites Manufacturers Association</h4>
				<p>
				<a href="http://www.acmanet.org">The American Composites Manufacturers Association (ACMA)</a> is a non profit trade association that is dedicated to expanding the use of composites materials including glass-fiber and carbon-fiber in manufactured products. The most frequent products the association advocates for include automotive vehicles, bridge decking, corrosive resistant tanks and bathroom vanities. 
				<p>
				At ACMA I was responsible for the growth initiative committees which included:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="style1">Architectural Division</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Automotive Composites Alliance</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Corrosion Control Division</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Fiberglass Grating Manufacturers Council</span>
						<li><span class="style1">FRP-Rebar Manufacturers Council</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Green Composites Council</span>
						<li><span class="style1">High Performance Council</span>
						<li><span class="style1">International Cast Polymer Alliance</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Pultrusion Industry Council</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Press Molders Council</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Transportation Structures Council</span>
						<li><span class="style1">Utility & Communications Structures Council</span>
					</ul>
				<p>
				Each committee has a volunteer chair who was responsible for accomplishing the goals and projects that committee members agreed to.  I worked with each chair to complete the logistical tasks such as meeting prep and follow-up, minutes, project management and fundraising.
