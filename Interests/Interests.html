			<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
				I enjoy outdoor activities including <span class="italics">tennis, hiking, rock climbing, biking, waterparks, and basketball.</span> I also enjoy spending time with family playing games and making family movies.
				<p>
				My claim to fame is I climbed a 20,000 foot mountain in Bolivia called <span class="italics">Huayna Potosi </span>located on the outskirts of La Paz.  The climb was one of the most difficult physical activities I have ever done.  During the climb I got altitude sickness, but I wasn't going to let that stop me.
				<p>
				I also enjoy car trips.  I have been to <span class="italics">every state in the United States except Hawaii</span> because there is no road to get there.  The longest car trip I was on lasted 4 weeks and traveled through 37 states.
				<p>
				In addition to car trips, I enjoy bus travel.  I have traveled through Latin American 	mostly by bus.  In Brazil I took a 36 hour bus ride from Belem to Joao Passoa. I have also traveled by bus from La Paz, Bolivia to Quito, Ecuador and from Panama City, Panama to San Salvador, El Salvador.
