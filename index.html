			I started my professional career in Washington D.C. in 2008 after graduating from Brigham Young University in Political Science. I worked for a small manufacturing trade association, <a href="http://www.acmanet.org"> American Composites Manufacturers Association (ACMA) </a> in their government affairs department and then in their composites growth department managing their Composites Growth Initiative Committees.  My positions at ACMA included: 
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li> <span class="style1">Executive Assistant </span></li>
					<li><span class="style1">Coordinator of Composites Growth and Grassroots Lobbying </span></li>
					<li><span class="style1">Manager, Administration and Operations </span></li>
					<li><span class="style1">Manager, Composites Growth Initiative Committees </span></li>
					
				</ul>
			<p>
			After 5 years at ACMA, I returned to Utah to pursue an Information Systems degree and start a career in Information Technology. </a>
			<p>
			I am currently a Maters student at the <a href="http://msis.business.utah.edu">University of Utah</a> and hope to graduate in December of this year.
